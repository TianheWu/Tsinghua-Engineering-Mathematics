# Tsinghua-Engineering-Mathematics

This repository mainly record Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School Engineering Mathematics course Experiments.

## Experiments-1: Series Summation of Hamming
This experiment is mainly to explore how to better reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

The main code is in ```hamming.cpp```, it includes basic algorithm, dynamic programming and power4 algorithm. You can check the generating results and true results with:
```
# Modify the data path to check

python utils.py
```

### Requiremnets (python)
- numpy, matplotlib

## Experiments-2: Interpolation
This experiment is mainly to explore the interpolation function, including Lagrange, Hermite and Newton.

The main code is in ```interpolation.py```, it includes the interpolation function. You can check the generating results and true results with:
```
python interpolation.py
```

### Requiremnets (python)
- numpy, sympy
